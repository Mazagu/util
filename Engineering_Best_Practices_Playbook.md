# üß≠ Engineering Best Practices Playbook

## üß± 1. Planning

- **Written Planning Process**  
  Use RFCs, Design Docs, or ADRs before implementation to clarify goals and gather feedback.

- **Standardized Architectural Diagrams**  
  Use tools like Lucidchart, Excalidraw, or PlantUML with a shared legend and consistent style.

- **Milestone Definition**  
  Break projects into phases with measurable deliverables and deadlines.

- **Stakeholder Communication**  
  Establish review cadences with product, engineering, and leadership.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Development

- **Environment Setup Automation**  
  Use Docker, DevContainers, Gitpod, or bootstrap scripts for quick onboarding.

- **Prototyping**  
  Build throwaway prototypes to test ideas before formal implementation.

- **Code Reviews**  
  All non-trivial code must be peer-reviewed for clarity, performance, and maintainability.

- **Automated Code Formatting**  
  Enforce styles using Prettier, Black, gofmt, etc.

- **Linting**  
  Use ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop to catch style and logic issues early.

- **Static Code Analysis**  
  Tools like SonarQube, Snyk, or CodeQL to catch security and quality issues.

- **Project & Component Templates**  
  Use starter kits or clones with standard structure, lint/test config, and CI.

- **Code Generation**  
  Automate boilerplate with tools like Hygen, Plop, or custom generators.

- **Post-Commit Code Reviews**  
  Used in small or high-velocity teams. Allows faster iteration at risk of regressions.

- **Cross-Platform Development**  
  Use frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Capacitor to maximize code reuse.

- **CI/CD**  
  Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI to automate testing, building, and deployment.

## üß™ 3. Testing

- **Automated Testing**  
  Use a pyramid of:
  - Unit tests  
  - Integration tests  
  - End-to-end (E2E) tests  
  - Performance & load tests

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
  Write tests before the implementation to drive design and correctness.

- **Preview Environments**  
  Use ephemeral PR environments via Vercel, Netlify, or custom infrastructure.

- **Staging/QA Environments**  
  Isolate testing environments before production rollout.

- **Testing in Production**  
  Use safe methods: feature flags, shadow traffic, or canary releases.

- **Test Data Generation**  
  Use factories, scripts, or production forks (with redaction) for realism.

- **Load Testing**  
  Use tools like k6, JMeter, or Locust to simulate heavy traffic.

- **Performance Benchmarking**  
  Benchmark CPU, memory, I/O and automate performance regressions checks.

## üö¢ 4. Shipping

- **Feature Flags & A/B Testing**  
  Roll out features gradually and experiment safely with LaunchDarkly, Unleash, etc.

- **Progressive Delivery**  
  Staged rollouts, blue-green deployments, and canary releases.

- **Monitoring & Alerting**  
  Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic for live monitoring.

- **Structured Logging**  
  Use JSON-based logs with correlation IDs and log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack).

- **Observability**  
  Add OpenTelemetry for tracing, metrics, and logs visibility.

---

## üîß 5. Maintenance

- **Production Debugging**  
  Tools like Sentry, Datadog, Honeycomb, or in-house observability platforms.

- **Documentation**  
  Auto-generated or hand-written using tools like Docusaurus, MkDocs, etc.

- **Runbooks**  
  Include alert resolution steps, escalation contacts, and common fixes.

- **Migration Runbooks**  
  Plan and automate data/code migrations with safety and rollback procedures.
