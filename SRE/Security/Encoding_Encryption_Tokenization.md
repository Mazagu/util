# üîê Encoding vs Encryption vs Tokenization: Data Handling Explained

When designing secure and robust systems, it's critical to understand the differences between **encoding**, **encryption**, and **tokenization**. These techniques are often confused, but each serves a different purpose in the way data is transformed, protected, and transmitted.

---

## üîÑ Encoding

### üß† What It Is

**Encoding** is the process of converting data into a different format using a known, reversible scheme. It is **not meant to protect data** but to ensure it can be **properly consumed by systems that expect text-based formats**.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Transmitting binary data over text-only protocols (e.g., email, JSON)
- URI and HTML escaping
- Storing structured data in query strings or headers

### üîß Example: Base64 Encoding

```
import base64

message = "Hello, world!"
encoded = base64.b64encode(message.encode("utf-8"))
print(encoded)  # b'SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=='
```

> ‚úÖ Easily reversible  
> ‚ùå Not secure ‚Äì anyone can decode it

### üîê Key Point

> **Encoding ‚â† Encryption**. It ensures **readability**, not **confidentiality**.

---

## üîê Encryption

### üß† What It Is

**Encryption** transforms plaintext into unreadable **ciphertext** using a **cryptographic key**. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt the data.

There are two types:
- **Symmetric encryption** ‚Äì Same key for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES)
- **Asymmetric encryption** ‚Äì Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (e.g., RSA)

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Securing sensitive data in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Protecting stored user data (PII, passwords)
- Encrypted messaging apps

### üîß Example: AES (Python - symmetric encryption)

```
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

key = get_random_bytes(16)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(b"Sensitive Data")

print(ciphertext)
```

> ‚úÖ Strong protection of data  
> ‚ùå Requires key management  
> ‚úÖ Reversible only with the key

### üîê Key Point

> Encryption ensures **confidentiality**, especially when paired with **authentication** and **integrity checks**.

---

## ü™ô Tokenization

### üß† What It Is

**Tokenization** replaces sensitive data with a **non-sensitive equivalent (a token)**. The mapping between the token and the original data is stored securely in a **token vault**.

Tokens have **no mathematical relationship** with the original data, making them useless to attackers.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- PCI DSS compliance (credit card info)
- Protecting PII in microservices
- Data privacy in analytics pipelines

### üîß Example: Tokenization Workflow

```
Original Data: "4242 4242 4242 4242"
Token: "tok_87b2f1a8"

# The mapping is only known inside a secure token vault.
```

> ‚úÖ Irreversible without token vault  
> ‚úÖ Excellent for data minimization  
> ‚ùå Requires secure infrastructure to manage token storage

### üîê Key Point

> Tokenization **removes sensitive data** from the operational system and **replaces it with a reference**.

## üîê Bonus: Combining Strategies

These methods can **coexist** in secure systems.

Example flow:
1. User data is **tokenized** to remove PII
2. The token is **encrypted** for secure storage
3. The encrypted token is **Base64-encoded** for transmission via HTTP
