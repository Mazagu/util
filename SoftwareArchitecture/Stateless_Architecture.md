# 🧱 Stateless Architecture

**Stateless Architecture** is a foundational concept for scalable and resilient systems, especially in cloud-native and distributed environments.

---

## 📘 1. What is Stateless Architecture?

A **stateless system** does not store client or session information between requests. Each request is **independent**, self-contained, and carries all necessary context.

---

## 🔄 2. Stateless vs Stateful

| Aspect           | Stateless                            | Stateful                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Request Memory   | No memory of previous requests        | Maintains context across requests        |
| Scalability      | Easier to scale                      | Harder to scale (session affinity needed)|
| Resilience       | More fault-tolerant                  | Susceptible to session loss              |
| Examples         | REST APIs, Load-balanced Microservices| WebSockets, Online Games, Legacy apps    |

## 🔧 3. Benefits of Stateless Architecture

- ✅ **Easy horizontal scaling**
- 🔄 **Better fault tolerance**
- 🧪 **Simplified testing**
- ☁️ **Cloud-native compatibility**
- 🔐 **Improved security** (less stored state to compromise)

---

## 🚧 4. Challenges of Statelessness

- Handling user sessions (authentication, carts)
- Handling long-running workflows
- Need to move session/state to **external systems** (e.g. databases, caches, tokens)

---

## 🛠️ 5. Patterns to Achieve Statelessness

### 🔐 Token-based Authentication

Use **JWT** or **PASETO** tokens that carry user data in each request.

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### 🧠 External State Management

Move session data to external stores like:
- Redis (caching)
- RDBMS or NoSQL (persistent session state)

### 📨 Idempotency

Ensure APIs can safely retry without side effects.

```
POST /orders
Idempotency-Key: 12345-abcde
```

## 🧰 6. Stateless Technologies

| Area            | Technologies                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Auth             | JWT, OAuth2, PASETO                  |
| Caching          | Redis, Memcached                     |
| APIs             | REST, GraphQL (stateless by design)  |
| Infra            | Serverless, Kubernetes, Containers   |

---

## 🌐 7. Real-World Examples

- **REST APIs**: Each call is self-contained.
- **CDNs**: Serve cached resources without user state.
- **FaaS**: Serverless functions like AWS Lambda are stateless by nature.

---

## 🔍 8. When Not to Use Stateless Design

- Real-time communication (e.g. chat, multiplayer games)
- Complex stateful workflows
- Cases where performance relies on local session data

---

## ✅ 9. Statelessness Checklist

- [ ] Is all required context included in each request?
- [ ] Is session data stored externally?
- [ ] Are retries idempotent and safe?
- [ ] Is horizontal scaling supported without session stickiness?
- [ ] Is authentication stateless?
