# üåê Guide to API Protocols (By Importance & Use Case)

Modern systems use a variety of API protocols depending on communication needs like request/response, event streaming, or messaging. This guide walks through key API protocols in order of relevance, adoption, and technical use case.

---

## ü•á 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)

**What it is:**  
The most widely adopted HTTP-based architectural style for designing networked applications.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Stateless, scalable, simple to implement
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Easily understood and supported by all clients

**Best for:** CRUD APIs, microservices, public APIs

```
// Sample REST GET request
GET /api/users/123
Host: api.example.com
```

---

## ü•à 2. Webhooks

**What it is:**  
Server-to-server communication triggered by events. The provider pushes data to a URL you control.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Ideal for **event-driven architectures**
- Real-time notifications (e.g., payment, delivery updates)

**Best for:** Third-party integrations, automation, async event delivery

---

## ü•â 3. GraphQL

**What it is:**  
A query language that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Prevents over-fetching and under-fetching
- Strongly typed schema
- Ideal for frontend-driven APIs

**Best for:** Mobile/web apps, federated APIs

```
// GraphQL sample query
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

---

## 4. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

**What it is:**  
A high-performance RPC protocol based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Great for internal microservice communication
- Low latency, compact data transfer
- Supports streaming

**Best for:** Backend services, real-time systems

```
// gRPC uses protobuf definitions
rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
```

---

## 5. WebSockets

**What it is:**  
A full-duplex communication protocol over a single TCP connection.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Maintains open connection between client and server
- Ideal for real-time updates and messaging

**Best for:** Chat apps, multiplayer games, live dashboards

---

## 6. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

**What it is:**  
A lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol optimized for IoT.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Works on unreliable networks
- Minimal bandwidth and battery usage

**Best for:** IoT devices, sensors, telemetry

---

## 7. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

**What it is:**  
A robust messaging protocol used in brokers like RabbitMQ.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Reliable, transactional message delivery
- Supports routing, queueing, pub/sub

**Best for:** Enterprise apps, asynchronous workflows

---

## 8. SSE (Server-Sent Events)

**What it is:**  
A simple way to send unidirectional updates from server to client over HTTP.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Works over HTTP/1.1
- Simpler than WebSockets for push-only needs

**Best for:** Notifications, stock tickers, real-time feeds

```
// SSE Example
event: message
data: {"user": "John", "msg": "Hello"}
```

---

## 9. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

**What it is:**  
An XML-based protocol over HTTP/SMTP.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Strict contracts (WSDL)
- Still used in many legacy enterprise systems

**Best for:** Financial services, legacy B2B integrations

---

## 10. EDA (Event-Driven Architecture)

**What it is:**  
A system design pattern where components react to emitted events.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Enables decoupling
- High scalability and resilience

**Protocol-agnostic**: Often implemented with Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, etc.

---

## 11. EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

**What it is:**  
Standardized formats for exchanging business documents between companies.

**Why it‚Äôs important:**  
- Still widely used in logistics, healthcare, and finance
- Supports invoicing, shipment notices, purchase orders

**Best for:** B2B supply chain automation
