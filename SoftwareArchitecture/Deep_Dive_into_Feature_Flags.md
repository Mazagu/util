# 🚩 Deep Dive into Feature Flags

Feature flags (also known as **feature toggles**) allow teams to turn features on or off at runtime **without deploying new code**. They are critical for **continuous delivery**, **experimentation**, and **safe deployments**.

---

## 🎯 What Are Feature Flags?

Feature flags are conditional statements in code that control the availability of features.

```
if (featureFlags.newCheckoutFlow) {
  renderNewCheckout();
} else {
  renderOldCheckout();
}
```

## 🧰 Types of Feature Flags

### 1. **Release Flags**
Used to deploy incomplete or risky features safely.

- Enable a feature for internal users or beta testers.
- Gradually roll out a new feature to users.

### 2. **Experiment Flags (A/B Testing)**
Used to measure the performance or behavior of variants.

- Compare “Feature A” vs. “Feature B” in production.
- Integrates well with analytics tools.

### 3. **Ops Flags**
Enable or disable infrastructure or operational behavior.

- Toggle log levels, enable debug mode, etc.
- Control circuit breakers or database fallbacks.

### 4. **Permission Flags**
Used for role-based or user-specific access.

- Enable premium features for paid users only.
- Enable admin-only features.

### 5. **Kill Switch Flags**
Instantly disable broken or risky features.

- Emergency toggle to turn off a feature causing issues.

## ⚙️ How Feature Flags Work

Flags are typically defined in:

- **Config files**
- **Environment variables**
- **Remote config services** (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Flagsmith)

They may be evaluated:

- At **build-time** (compile-time)
- At **runtime** (client/server-side)
- Based on **context** (user role, geolocation, etc.)

---

## 🌐 Architecture and Storage

Feature flags can be stored in:

- JSON/YAML files
- In-memory cache
- Remote config services with SDKs
- Feature management platforms

```
// Example: Remote flag check
const flag = await getFlag('newSearchBar');
if (flag.enabled) showNewSearch();
```

## 🧪 Best Practices

✅ **Use descriptive flag names**
- e.g., `enableAdvancedFilters`, not `flag123`

✅ **Clean up stale flags**
- Prevent "flag debt" (unused toggles that clutter code)

✅ **Keep flag logic simple**
- Avoid deeply nested conditions with multiple flags

✅ **Audit flag usage**
- Know who owns each flag and why it exists

✅ **Test both sides of a flag**
- Ensure feature **on** and **off** paths are covered

---

## 🔥 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

🚫 **Using flags as permanent config**
- Long-lived flags become hidden config values

🚫 **Too many flags in the same module**
- Leads to combinatorial explosion and logic complexity

🚫 **Not versioning flags**
- Changing meaning over time without tracking can cause regressions

## 🚀 Tools & Services

| Tool           | Type              | Notes                                     |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **LaunchDarkly** | Commercial SaaS    | Powerful targeting, auditing, SDK support |
| **Unleash**      | Open-source       | Self-hosted, SDKs in many languages       |
| **Flagsmith**    | Open-source + SaaS| Hybrid deployment support                 |
| **ConfigCat**    | SaaS              | Easy-to-use UI, targeting rules           |
| **Split.io**     | Commercial        | A/B testing and flag management           |

## 👷 Use Cases

- **Progressive delivery** of features
- **Canary releases** with staged rollouts
- **Blue/green deployments**
- **A/B testing** and experimentation
- **Hotfixes** without deploying

---

## 📌 Summary

- Feature flags decouple deployment from release.
- They enable faster iteration, safer rollouts, and targeted experimentation.
- Clean-up and good governance are **critical** to avoiding tech debt.
