# 🚀 System Design: Scalability & Performance Guide

Building scalable and performant systems requires careful decisions across architecture, infrastructure, and code. This guide covers key strategies and considerations.

## ⚖️ 1. What Is Scalability?

- **Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle increased load without compromising performance.
- **Performance** is how fast the system responds under a given load.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Types of Scalability

### 🧱 Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
- Add more resources (CPU, RAM) to existing machines
- Simpler but has hardware limits

### 🌐 Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
- Add more machines (servers, nodes) to the system
- Requires distributed system design
- Needs load balancing, replication, stateless components

## 📊 3. Key Metrics

| Metric            | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Latency**        | Time to respond to a single request         |
| **Throughput**     | Requests processed per unit of time         |
| **Error Rate**     | Failed requests ratio                       |
| **Resource Usage** | CPU, memory, disk, and network consumption |

## 🧠 4. Strategies to Improve Performance

### 💡 Caching
- Reduce expensive computations or DB lookups
- Types:
  - **In-Memory**: Redis, Memcached
  - **Read-Through**, **Write-Through**, **Write-Behind**
  - **CDNs** for static content

### 🏎️ Load Balancing
- Distribute traffic across multiple nodes
- Algorithms: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing
- Use HAProxy, NGINX, or cloud load balancers

### ✳️ Asynchronous Processing
- Offload heavy tasks to background jobs
- Use queues: RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS, Sidekiq
- Improves user-facing responsiveness

### 🧵 Concurrency & Parallelism
- Use multi-threading and async IO
- Exploit CPU cores and reduce blocking calls

---

## 🧱 5. Scalability Patterns

### 🔁 Replication
- Clone data/services across nodes
- Improves read scalability and fault tolerance

### 🍰 Sharding (Partitioning)
- Divide data across multiple databases or tables
- Avoids single-node bottlenecks

### 🧩 Microservices
- Break system into independently scalable services
- Enables scaling hot spots independently

---

## ⚙️ 6. System Design Techniques

### 🗃️ Data Modeling
- Denormalize data for performance
- Use time-series DBs for metrics
- Index wisely

### 🧹 Queueing
- Decouple producers and consumers
- Smooth out traffic spikes

### 🧪 Load Testing
- Tools: Apache JMeter, k6, Locust
- Identify bottlenecks before they hit production

## 🔐 7. Design Trade-Offs

| Trade-Off                    | Consideration                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Latency vs. Consistency** | Eventual consistency may boost perf.   |
| **Freshness vs. Caching**   | Cached data may be slightly outdated   |
| **Cost vs. Throughput**     | More infra = more cost                 |
| **Complexity vs. Flexibility** | Scalability often adds complexity    |

## 📋 8. Scalability Review Checklist

- [ ] Are critical components stateless?
- [ ] Can the system scale horizontally?
- [ ] Is caching implemented for hot paths?
- [ ] Is load balanced properly?
- [ ] Are async jobs used for slow tasks?
- [ ] Have we load tested at expected traffic levels?
- [ ] Have we defined SLAs for latency/throughput?
