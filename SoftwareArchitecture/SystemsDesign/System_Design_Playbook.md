# 🧠 System Design Playbook: Common Issues and Proven Solutions

This guide offers a structured reference for addressing **common challenges in system design** with **battle-tested solutions**. Ideal for architects, engineers, and developers working on building scalable, reliable systems.

---

## 1. ⚡ Read-Heavy Systems

### 🔍 Problem:
Frequent reads on the same data degrade performance and increase latency.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Use Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in fast-access memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- **Read Replicas**: Offload reads to database replicas.
- **CDNs**: Serve static content from edge servers close to the user.

---

## 2. 📝 Write-Heavy Systems

### 🔍 Problem:
Frequent writes can overwhelm the database and increase latency.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Async Write Queue**: Offload heavy writes to background workers using queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- **LSM Tree Databases**: Use databases optimized for heavy writes (e.g., Cassandra, RocksDB).
- **Batched Writes**: Aggregate updates and write in bulk.

---

## 3. 🧨 Single Point of Failure

### 🔍 Problem:
Failure in one component takes down the entire system.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple instances of critical components.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Auto-switch to backup resources.
- **HAProxies** and **Load Balancers**: Automatically reroute traffic to healthy services.

---

## 4. 🟢 High Availability

### 🔍 Problem:
System downtime is unacceptable.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute requests across multiple healthy instances.
- **Database Replication**: Enable failover and distribute read traffic.
- **Health Checks**: Use probes to monitor instance health.
- **Stateless Services**: Make services replaceable and scalable.

---

## 5. 🐢 High Latency

### 🔍 Problem:
Slow response times frustrate users.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **CDNs**: Distribute static content geographically.
- **Caching**: Serve precomputed or frequently accessed data.
- **Edge Computing**: Push computation closer to the user.

---

## 6. 📦 Handling Large Files

### 🔍 Problem:
Large files and media assets can overload servers or databases.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Object Storage**: Use S3, MinIO, or GCS to store files.
- **Block Storage**: Use high-performance disks for file systems.
- **Presigned URLs**: Allow clients to upload/download directly from storage services.

---

## 7. 🛠️ Monitoring and Alerting

### 🔍 Problem:
No visibility into system failures or anomalies.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Centralized Logging**: Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki.
- **Alerting Systems**: Use Prometheus + Alertmanager or PagerDuty.
- **Dashboards**: Visualize metrics with Grafana or Datadog.

---

## 8. 🐌 Slow Database Queries

### 🔍 Problem:
Database queries take too long, causing bottlenecks.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Indexing**: Add indexes on commonly queried columns.
- **Query Optimization**: Rewrite queries for efficiency.
- **Read Replicas**: Distribute load.
- **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple DB instances.

---

## 9. 📶 Handling Sudden Traffic Spikes

### 🔍 Problem:
System crashes under unexpected load.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Auto-Scaling**: Scale horizontally using Kubernetes or cloud autoscalers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect backends from abuse.
- **Load Shedding**: Reject non-essential traffic when overloaded.

---

## 10. 🔁 Stateful vs Stateless Services

### 🔍 Problem:
Stateful services are hard to scale and recover.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Make Services Stateless**: Store session/state in external systems like Redis.
- **Sticky Sessions**: Route user requests to the same instance if needed.

---

## 11. 🔓 Security Concerns

### 🔍 Problem:
Sensitive data is at risk, or services are vulnerable.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypt all traffic.
- **JWT and OAuth2**: Secure API access.
- **RBAC**: Implement role-based access control.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like Trivy or Snyk.

---

## 12. 🌐 Geographic Distribution

### 🔍 Problem:
Users across regions experience varying latency.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Global CDNs**: Push static content to edge locations.
- **Multi-region Deployments**: Use cloud infrastructure to run replicas across continents.
- **Geo-aware Load Balancing**: Route users to the nearest region.

---

## 13. ⚙️ Data Consistency vs Availability

### 🔍 Problem:
You can’t always get strong consistency and high availability (CAP Theorem).

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Choose per need**:
  - Use **CP** (Consistency/Partition Tolerance) for financial systems.
  - Use **AP** (Availability/Partition Tolerance) for social feeds or analytics.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept delays for performance and availability.

---

## 14. 🪵 Event-Driven Architectures

### 🔍 Problem:
Monolithic workflows are slow and inflexible.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Use Pub-Sub**: Decouple producers and consumers (Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ).
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintain a log of all changes to state.
- **CQRS**: Separate reads and writes for performance.

---

## 15. 🧠 Smart Retry & Circuit Breakers

### 🔍 Problem:
Cascading failures due to retries and unresponsive services.

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Retry Strategies**: Use exponential backoff with jitter.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Stop repeated calls to failing services.
- **Timeouts**: Never wait forever; use sensible defaults.

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Designing resilient systems means **anticipating failure** and **planning for scalability**. The patterns in this playbook are commonly applied in real-world architectures from companies like Netflix, Uber, and Google.
