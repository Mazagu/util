# üîÑ Guide: Consistent Hashing ‚Äî A Systems Design Deep Dive

**Consistent hashing** is a key technique in system design for **evenly distributing load across dynamic server nodes** without needing to reassign all keys when the cluster topology changes.

It is widely used in:
- **Distributed caches** (e.g., Memcached, Redis)
- **Sharded databases** (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- **Load balancers**
- **Distributed file systems**

---

## üéØ 1. The Problem with Naive Hashing

Let‚Äôs say you distribute keys using:
```
node = hash(key) % N
```

‚ùå When `N` (the number of servers) changes, **almost all keys are remapped**, which causes:
- Cache misses
- Massive data movement
- Load imbalance

---

## üß† 2. What Is Consistent Hashing?

Consistent hashing solves this by mapping **both nodes and keys onto the same circular hash space** (a ring). 

- Each **node** is assigned a hash position on the ring.
- Each **key** is assigned a hash and placed on the ring.
- A key is stored in the **first node clockwise** from its position.

```
// Example: simplified concept
nodes = ["A", "B", "C"]
hash_ring = sorted([hash(n) for n in nodes])
key_hash = hash("user42")
target_node = find_first_node_clockwise(hash_ring, key_hash)
```

‚úÖ When a node is added/removed, **only a small subset of keys** move  
‚úÖ Maintains **balanced distribution** and **scales smoothly**

---

## üåÄ 3. The Hash Ring

Visualize the hash space as a circle:

```
   0 ----------------> 2^32-1
   ^                  |
   |     Node B       |
   |     ‚Üë            ‚Üì
   |  Node A      Node C
   --------------------
```

- A key hashed to a point between A and B is routed to B.
- If B is removed, A or C will pick up B's segment.

---

## üß© 4. Virtual Nodes (VNodes)

**Virtual nodes** improve balance and fault tolerance:

- Each physical node is assigned multiple **virtual positions** on the ring
- This avoids uneven load if one node lands in a sparse region

```
# Node A gets 100 virtual nodes
for i in range(100):
    ring.add(hash("A#" + str(i)))
```

‚úÖ Better load distribution  
‚úÖ Easier rebalance during scale-up/down  
‚úÖ Faster recovery after failure

---

## üîÑ 5. When Nodes Join or Leave

### ‚úÖ Node Addition
- Only keys falling into the new node‚Äôs range are reassigned
- Minimal key movement

### ‚ùå Node Removal
- Keys that were on the removed node get reassigned to next clockwise node
- Other keys stay untouched

This **locality** and **stability** make consistent hashing ideal for dynamic systems.

## üì¶ 6. Use Cases
| Use Case                | Why Consistent Hashing Helps                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Distributed Caching     | Prevents cache misses on node changes       |
| Database Sharding       | Smooth resharding with minimal movement     |
| Load Balancing          | Assigns client requests to backend servers  |
| Partitioned Logs        | Distributes partitions across brokers       |
| Distributed File Stores | Maps files to storage servers efficiently   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Real-World Systems That Use It
| System         | Use of Consistent Hashing             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Amazon Dynamo** | Ring-based partitioning, VNodes         |
| **Cassandra**     | VNodes + token ring for partitioning   |
| **Riak**          | Core to key distribution and fault tolerance |
| **Memcached**     | Client-side hashing for cache routing  |
| **Envoy Proxy**   | Uses it in load balancing algorithms   |
| **Kafka**         | Custom partitioners based on hash ring |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 8. Pitfalls and Considerations
| Issue                  | Solution                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Hash imbalance         | Use **VNodes** to smooth the ring  |
| Hot keys (skew)        | Combine hashing + replication      |
| Hash collisions        | Use strong, uniform hash function  |
| Rebalancing complexity | Use libraries/tools (e.g. Ketama)  |

## üõ†Ô∏è 9. Sample Implementation (Python-like Pseudocode)

```
class ConsistentHashRing:
    def __init__(self, nodes, vnodes=100):
        self.ring = {}
        self.sorted_keys = []
        for node in nodes:
            for i in range(vnodes):
                key = hash(f"{node}#{i}")
                self.ring[key] = node
                self.sorted_keys.append(key)
        self.sorted_keys.sort()

    def get_node(self, item_key):
        key = hash(item_key)
        for k in self.sorted_keys:
            if key <= k:
                return self.ring[k]
        return self.ring[self.sorted_keys[0]]  # Wrap around
```
