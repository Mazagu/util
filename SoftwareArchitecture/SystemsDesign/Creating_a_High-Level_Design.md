# üèóÔ∏è System Design: Creating a High-Level Design (HLD)

High-Level Design (HLD) provides a **bird‚Äôs-eye view** of the architecture. It focuses on the **overall structure**, key **components**, **communication**, and **data flow** ‚Äî without diving into implementation details.

---

## üéØ Purpose of HLD

- Aligns **business needs** with technical implementation
- Enables discussions between **engineering**, **product**, and **stakeholders**
- Serves as a **blueprint** for Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Helps evaluate **trade-offs**, **scalability**, and **cost**

---

## üß© Key Elements of a High-Level Design

### 1. System Context Diagram

Describes how the system fits into the external world.

```
- Who are the users?
- What external systems does it integrate with?
- What protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)?
```

---

### 2. Component Breakdown

Break the system into major **modules** or **services**.

```
- API Gateway
- Authentication Service
- User Service
- Notification Service
- Database Layer
```

---

### 3. Communication Patterns

How components talk to each other.

```
- Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
```

---

### 4. Data Flow & Storage

Define what data is stored and how it flows between components.

```
- DBs: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Caches: Redis/Memcached
- File Storage: S3, Blob Storage
```

---

### 5. Availability & Scalability Plans

Show how the system will scale and handle failures.

```
- Load Balancers (HAProxy, ALB)
- Auto-scaling groups
- Database replication
- Failover mechanisms
```

---

### 6. Technology Stack

Summarize key technologies.

```
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Spring Boot
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Queue: Kafka
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
```

---

### 7. Key Non-Functional Requirements

```
- Latency requirements (e.g., < 200ms for key APIs)
- Throughput (e.g., 1,000 RPS peak)
- Uptime SLAs (e.g., 99.9%)
- Security (e.g., JWT, OAuth, mTLS)
```

---

## üìê Sample HLD Process (Step-by-step)

```
1. Understand requirements (functional + non-functional)
2. Identify main actors and use cases
3. Draft system context diagram
4. Define main components/services
5. Design interactions and APIs between components
6. Choose tech stack based on trade-offs
7. Plan for scaling, failure, and observability
8. Review with stakeholders (team, architects)
```

---

## üìù Example: Social Media Feed System

```
- API Gateway
  - Handles client traffic, forwards to backend
- Feed Service
  - Aggregates posts from followed users
- Post Service
  - Creates, updates, stores posts
- User Service
  - Manages profiles, followers
- Redis Cache
  - Stores recent posts for quick access
- PostgreSQL
  - Stores posts and user metadata
- Kafka
  - Event-driven updates between services
```

- **Sequence Diagrams** (optional)
- **Deployment View** (how components are deployed)

## ‚úÖ Tips for a Good HLD

- Avoid implementation details (leave those for LLD)
- Communicate ideas **visually** and **simply**
- Make it reviewable by **non-engineers**
- Highlight **trade-offs** made (e.g., consistency vs availability)
- Keep it versioned and up to date
