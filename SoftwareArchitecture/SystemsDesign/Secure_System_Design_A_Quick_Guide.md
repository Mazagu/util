# 🔐 Secure System Design: A Quick Guide

Designing secure systems requires a **comprehensive approach** that spans users, infrastructure, applications, APIs, and operations. This guide introduces key security areas and how to address them effectively.

---

## 🔑 1. Authentication

Authentication verifies **who** the user is.

- Use strong, modern mechanisms like:
  - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**
  - **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
  - **SSO (Single Sign-On)**
- Store passwords securely with salted hashes (e.g., `bcrypt`, `argon2`)
- Support secure session management with token expiration and revocation

---

## 🛂 2. Authorization

Authorization defines **what** authenticated users can access.

- Apply **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** or **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- Use **principle of least privilege**: grant only the necessary permissions
- Enforce authorization on every request, including internal microservices

---

## 🔒 3. Encryption

Encryption protects data **at rest and in transit**.

- **In Transit**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **At Rest**: Encrypt data using AES-256 or similar
- Use **key management systems** (KMS) like AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault
- Avoid hardcoding keys in codebases

---

## 🐞 4. Vulnerability Management

Find and fix security flaws proactively.

- Perform regular **code scanning** and **dependency auditing**
- Use tools like `Snyk`, `Dependabot`, `Trivy`, or `OWASP ZAP`
- Patch systems and third-party dependencies regularly
- Follow **OWASP Top 10** to address common risks

---

## 📜 5. Audit & Compliance

Ensure you can trace and prove secure behavior.

- Enable **audit logging** for critical actions (logins, config changes)
- Retain logs with **immutability and retention policies**
- Prepare for compliance frameworks like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **SOC2**

---

## 🌐 6. Network Security

Protect the network perimeter and internal communication.

- Use **firewalls**, **WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)**, and **NAT gateways**
- Segment networks (e.g., DMZ, internal-only zones)
- Block unused ports and protocols
- Apply **Zero Trust** principles for internal services

---

## 💻 7. Terminal Security

Secure access to production systems.

- Use **SSH key-based authentication** with expiration and rotation
- Enforce MFA for bastion access
- Implement **Just-in-Time (JIT) access** and **session recording**
- Disable root login and restrict sudo privileges

---

## 🚨 8. Emergency Responses

Prepare for incidents and threats.

- Define an **incident response plan** (IRP)
- Set up alerting for suspicious behavior
- Conduct **tabletop exercises** and post-mortems
- Use tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS for detection and response

---

## 📦 9. Container Security

Secure containerized environments like Docker or Kubernetes.

- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Use **read-only containers**, **non-root users**, and **resource limits**
- Apply **PodSecurityPolicies** / **Security Contexts**
- Keep orchestrators (like Kubernetes) updated

---

## 🧩 10. API Security

Protect internal and external APIs.

- Require **authentication and authorization** for all endpoints
- Validate input to avoid injection attacks (SQLi, XSS)
- Use **rate limiting**, **throttling**, and **API keys**
- Log usage for monitoring and abuse detection

---

## 🧾 11. 3rd-Party Vendor Management

Secure your dependencies and partnerships.

- Evaluate vendor **security posture** (SOC2, ISO certifications)
- Use **contracts and SLAs** that include security responsibilities
- Perform **regular assessments** and limit access to necessary scopes

---

## 🌪 12. Disaster Recovery

Plan for major outages and data loss.

- Implement **automated backups** and test **restore procedures**
- Use **geo-redundant infrastructure** for high availability
- Define **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
- Regularly simulate **disaster recovery drills**

---

## 🧠 Final Checklist

- ✅ Use secure defaults and fail closed
- ✅ Apply defense in depth across layers
- ✅ Automate security scanning and patching
- ✅ Educate the engineering team on secure practices
