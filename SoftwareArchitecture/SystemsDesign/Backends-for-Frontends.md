# 🧩 Backends-for-Frontends (BFF) — Quick Guide

Backends-for-Frontends (BFF) is a design pattern where you create **a dedicated backend for each frontend** (e.g., web, mobile, IoT). It helps tailor API responses, reduce over-fetching, and decouple frontend and backend teams.

---

## 🔧 What Is BFF?

A **BFF** is a service layer that sits between frontend applications and backend APIs or services. Each frontend (like Web, iOS, Android) can have its own BFF that caters specifically to its needs.

---

## 🎯 Why Use BFF?

- ✅ Tailor APIs to frontend needs (no over-fetching/under-fetching).
- ✅ Encapsulate frontend-specific logic (formatting, transformations).
- ✅ Enable faster frontend iteration without breaking backend services.
- ✅ Manage authentication, rate limits, caching, aggregation.
- ✅ Help enforce separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

---

## 🧱 Common Patterns

### 1. **Device-Specific BFFs**
Create separate BFFs for Web, Mobile, and others.
- `bff-web.example.com`
- `bff-mobile.example.com`

### 2. **Unified Gateway + BFF**
Use an API Gateway for routing + lightweight BFFs for logic.

### 3. **Micro-BFFs**
Frontend teams own and deploy their own micro-BFFs per domain or module.

### 4. **Monolith BFF**
One BFF service handles all frontend types. Useful for small teams.

## ⚙️ Responsibilities of a BFF

- Aggregate responses from multiple microservices
- Transform data formats for frontend needs
- Authenticate users and manage tokens
- Handle rate limiting or feature toggles
- Perform caching or batching
- Apply localization or feature experiments

---

## 📦 Example Use Case

```
GET /dashboard (from Mobile BFF)
→ Aggregates:
   - User Profile Service
   - Notifications Service
   - Billing Service
→ Returns mobile-optimized response
```

---

## 🛑 When *Not* to Use BFF

- When all clients can use the same generic backend.
- If your team is too small to maintain multiple backend layers.
- When API Gateway alone can do basic transformations.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Co-locate frontend and BFF teams for tight feedback loops.
- Keep BFF stateless and scalable.
- Use versioning to avoid breaking clients.
- Limit business logic in BFF — push that to backend services.

## 🏁 Summary

| Benefit             | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Tailored APIs       | Custom responses per device                 |
| Frontend Agility    | Changes in BFF don’t require backend changes|
| Simplified Frontend | Aggregates and flattens complex data        |
| Decoupled Logic     | Keeps UI logic out of core services         |
