# ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancing Use Cases Guide

Load balancing is critical for building **scalable, resilient, and high-performing systems**. Beyond basic traffic distribution, modern load balancers handle diverse use cases across infrastructure, performance, security, and user experience.

---

## üßØ 1. Failure Handling

**Purpose:**  
Automatically redirects traffic away from failed or degraded instances to ensure continuous service.

**How it works:**  
Load balancers detect unresponsive servers and stop routing traffic to them, avoiding downtime.

**Benefits:**
- High availability
- Reduced user-facing errors
- Automatic failover

```
// Example: NGINX marking upstream as down
upstream backend {
  server backend1.example.com;
  server backend2.example.com down;  # temporarily disabled
}
```

---

## ü©∫ 2. Instance Health Checks

**Purpose:**  
Ensures traffic is only sent to **healthy and responsive instances**.

**How it works:**  
- Active health checks (ping, HTTP response)
- Passive checks (detect errors from previous requests)

**Benefits:**
- Real-time monitoring
- Prevents routing to broken services

Tools: AWS ALB/NLB, GCP Load Balancing, HAProxy, NGINX

---

## üß† 3. Platform-Specific Routing

**Purpose:**  
Customize responses for different platforms or devices (e.g., desktop vs mobile).

**How it works:**  
Load balancer inspects request headers or user-agent to route accordingly.

**Use Cases:**
- Mobile-specific backend logic
- A/B testing across device classes
- Redirecting traffic based on capabilities

```
// Example: Detect platform via header
if ($http_user_agent ~* "Mobile") {
  proxy_pass http://mobile_backend;
}
```

## üîê 4. SSL Termination

**Purpose:**  
Offloads the burden of **SSL/TLS decryption** from backend services.

**How it works:**  
The load balancer handles SSL handshakes and sends decrypted HTTP to backend.

**Benefits:**
- Better backend performance
- Centralized certificate management
- Simplifies backend services

**Common in:**  
NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB, Cloudflare, Envoy

```
// NGINX SSL termination
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl.key;
  proxy_pass http://backend;
}
```

---

## üåç 5. Cross-Zone Load Balancing

**Purpose:**  
Spreads traffic evenly across **multiple zones or regions**.

**Why it matters:**  
- Reduces zone-specific overload
- Resilient against zone outages
- Improves performance by geo-routing

**Cloud Examples:**
- AWS: Enable cross-zone load balancing in ALB
- GCP: Global load balancing by default

---

## üß≤ 6. User Stickiness (Session Affinity)

**Purpose:**  
Routes a user consistently to the **same backend server**.

**When to use:**
- Applications storing sessions in memory (no shared session store)
- Avoid disrupting user workflows mid-session

**How it works:**
- Cookie-based stickiness
- Source IP-based affinity

**Caution:**  
Can cause unbalanced traffic if not managed properly.

```
// AWS ALB Example (Stickiness)
stickiness.enabled = true
stickiness.type = lb_cookie
```

---

## üìç 7. Geo-Based Routing

**Purpose:**  
Routes users to the closest or most relevant regional instance.

**Why it's useful:**
- Reduces latency
- Improves compliance (e.g., data residency)
- Enhances user experience

**Cloud Services:**  
AWS Route 53 Geolocation, Cloudflare Load Balancing, GCP Global LB

---

## üö¶ 8. Rate Limiting & Traffic Shaping

**Purpose:**  
Prevent abuse, apply quotas, or smooth traffic surges.

**How it works:**
- Enforce limits per IP, user, or API key
- Apply throttling to preserve backend stability

```
// Example: NGINX rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;
limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20;
```

## üß± 9. Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing

| Feature            | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)            | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)         |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Routing Criteria   | IP, Port                     | URL path, headers, cookies   |
| Flexibility        | Fast, simple                 | Smart, flexible routing      |
| Protocol Support   | TCP, UDP                     | HTTP, gRPC, WebSockets       |
| Common Tools       | AWS NLB, HAProxy             | NGINX, AWS ALB, Envoy        |

---

## üß™ 10. Canary Deployments & A/B Testing

**Purpose:**  
Route a small percentage of traffic to a **new version** of your service for testing.

**How it helps:**
- Minimize blast radius
- Collect feedback and metrics
- Roll back safely if needed

**Implementation:**  
Weighted routing rules, traffic splitting (Istio, Linkerd, AWS App Mesh)
