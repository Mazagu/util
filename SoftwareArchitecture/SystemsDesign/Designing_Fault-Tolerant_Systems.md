# Designing Fault-Tolerant Systems – Quick Guide

Designing fault-tolerant systems means building applications that can continue to operate, perhaps at a reduced level, even when some of their components fail. Below are core strategies and principles for fault-tolerant architecture.

---

## 🔁 Redundancy

Duplicate critical components so the system can fall back if one part fails.

- **Active-Passive**: One node is active, the other is on standby.
- **Active-Active**: All nodes handle traffic and share load.

---

## ⚙️ Failover Mechanisms

Automatic switchover to a redundant or standby system when a failure is detected.

- Example: A load balancer rerouting traffic if an instance becomes unhealthy.
```
health_check:
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 3s
  retries: 2
  on_fail: switch_node
```

---

## 📡 Monitoring & Alerting

Real-time observability into system health using tools like:

- **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics
- **ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for logs
- **Alertmanager, PagerDuty** for notifications

---

## 💥 Graceful Degradation

Design systems to lose functionality progressively instead of crashing entirely.

- Example: Show cached data if real-time API fails.
```
try {
  const data = await fetchLiveData();
  display(data);
} catch (e) {
  const fallback = getCachedData();
  display(fallback);
}
```

---

## 🧱 Circuit Breakers

Prevent cascading failures by cutting off requests to failing services.

- Use libraries like **Hystrix**, **resilience4j**, or **Polly**.
```
if (failureCount > threshold) {
  openCircuit();
}
```

---

## 💾 Retries with Backoff

Retry operations that fail due to transient errors using exponential backoff and jitter.
```
retryDelay = baseDelay * (2 ** retryCount) + randomJitter();
```

---

## 🔄 Idempotency

Ensure that repeated requests don't have unintended effects — crucial in retries.

- Example: Use idempotency keys in API calls:
```
POST /payment
Idempotency-Key: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

---

## 📤 Eventual Consistency

Let data become consistent over time rather than instantly.

- Often used in distributed systems and microservices.
- Use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async communication.

---

## 🔁 Load Balancing

Distribute requests across multiple servers to avoid overloading any one node.

- Horizontal scaling helps isolate failures.

---

## 🗃️ Data Replication

Keep multiple copies of data across different nodes or regions for high availability.

- Supports disaster recovery.
- Can be synchronous or asynchronous.

---

## 🧪 Chaos Engineering

Intentionally inject failures to test the system’s resilience.

- Tools: **Gremlin**, **Chaos Monkey**, **LitmusChaos**

---

## 🧯 Disaster Recovery

Have a documented and tested recovery plan:

- **Backups**: Automate and verify regularly.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss.

## Summary Checklist ✅

- [x] Redundancy in infrastructure and services
- [x] Health checks and automatic failovers
- [x] Monitoring and alerting
- [x] Graceful degradation paths
- [x] Circuit breakers in service-to-service calls
- [x] Retry mechanisms with idempotency
- [x] Load balancing and replication
- [x] Chaos testing and DR plans

---

By adopting these practices, you can design resilient, self-healing systems that degrade gracefully and maintain service availability even during component failures.
