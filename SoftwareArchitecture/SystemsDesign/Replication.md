# 🧬 Guide: Replication — A Systems Design Deep Dive

**Replication** is the process of copying and maintaining data across multiple machines to improve **availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **read scalability**.

It’s a foundational building block in distributed systems, used by databases, file systems, caches, and messaging systems.

---

## 📦 1. What is Replication?

Replication means maintaining **redundant copies of data** on different nodes (replicas) in a system.

This helps ensure:
- **High availability** (data still accessible if a node fails)
- **Improved read performance** (load balancing reads)
- **Disaster recovery** and backups

---

## 🧭 2. Types of Replication

### 🟢 1. **Master–Slave (Primary–Replica)**

One node (master) handles **writes**, and one or more slaves **replicate** the data asynchronously.

```
Client → Write → Master
Client → Read  → Replica
```

✅ Simple and scalable reads  
❌ Risk of **stale reads** due to replication lag

---

### 🟡 2. **Multi-Master Replication**

Multiple nodes can **accept writes** and sync with each other.

✅ High availability, write flexibility  
❌ Requires **conflict resolution** (e.g., last-write-wins, CRDTs)

---

### 🔁 3. **Peer-to-Peer / Gossip**

Every node shares state changes with peers (e.g. Cassandra, Dynamo).

✅ No single point of failure  
❌ **Eventually consistent**, needs careful design

---

## ⏱️ 3. Sync vs Async Replication
| Type           | Description                            | Trade-offs                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Synchronous** | Waits for replica to acknowledge       | Strong consistency, higher write latency   |
| **Asynchronous**| Returns immediately after master write | Low latency, risk of data loss on failure  |
| **Semi-Sync**   | Master waits for one replica           | Balance between safety and speed           |

---

## 🧪 4. Consistency Trade-offs

### Write and Read Patterns:

- **Write to master, read from replica** → eventual consistency
- **Read-your-writes** → read from same node (or quorum)

### CAP Theorem:

You can’t have all 3:
- **Consistency**
- **Availability**
- **Partition Tolerance**

Replication helps with **availability**, but often sacrifices **consistency**.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Failover and Recovery

### 🔧 Detecting Failures
- Heartbeats (ping health)
- Timeouts and retries
- Leader election (e.g., via Raft or ZooKeeper)

### 🔄 Automatic Failover
- Promote replica to master
- Update routing/config
- Restore original replica when available

```
// Example: Redis Sentinel failover
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2
sentinel failover mymaster
```

## 📊 6. Use Cases and Real-World Systems
| Use Case               | Replication Strategy            | Example Systems               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Read-heavy workloads   | Master–replica, async            | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis      |
| Global low latency     | Geo-replication, eventual        | DynamoDB, Cassandra           |
| High consistency needed| Quorum or synchronous writes     | CockroachDB, Spanner, etcd    |
| Streaming updates      | Change Data Capture (CDC)        | Debezium, Kafka Connect       |

## ⚠️ 7. Common Challenges
| Problem                    | Notes                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Replication lag            | Async replicas behind master writes        |
| Split-brain               | Multiple primaries writing simultaneously   |
| Conflict resolution        | Needed for multi-master scenarios          |
| Data loss on crash         | Async replicas may miss recent writes      |
| Write amplification        | More writes = more replication overhead    |

## 📚 8. Replication in Databases and Systems
| System         | Strategy                 | Notes                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Streaming replication    | Logical & physical, WAL-based         |
| **MySQL**      | Binlog-based async       | Semi-sync available                   |
| **MongoDB**    | Replica sets             | Built-in failover                     |
| **Cassandra**  | Quorum + gossip          | Tunable consistency                   |
| **Kafka**      | Log replication          | ISR (in-sync replicas) model          |
| **Redis**      | Master-replica, Sentinel | Redis Cluster for sharded replication |

---

## 🧠 9. Designing for Replication

- Use **idempotent operations** to handle retries
- Ensure **logical clocks or vector clocks** to detect conflicts
- Design around **eventual consistency** when needed
- Combine replication with **partitioning** for scalability
