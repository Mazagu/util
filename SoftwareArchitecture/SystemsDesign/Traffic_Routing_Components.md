# üåê Traffic Routing Components
In modern system architecture, it's crucial to understand the differences and overlaps between **reverse proxies**, **API gateways**, and **load balancers**. These components handle traffic routing, improve performance, enforce policies, and increase system resilience ‚Äî but serve different roles.

---

## üß≠ Overview: Key Concepts

| Component        | Primary Role                                  | Operates At        |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes traffic across servers             | Network / Transport |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Intercepts and forwards client requests        | Application Layer   |
| **API Gateway**   | Manages, routes, and secures API requests      | Application Layer   |
| **Forward Proxy** | Client-side proxy for outbound traffic         | Client-Side         |
| **Ingress Controller** | Manages external access to Kubernetes services | Kubernetes Layer     |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer

### üß† What It Does

A **Load Balancer** spreads incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to **maximize performance**, ensure **high availability**, and avoid **overloading** any single server.

### üîß Types

- **Layer 4 (Transport)**: Balances based on IP/port (TCP/UDP)
- **Layer 7 (Application)**: Balances based on HTTP headers, cookies, paths

```
// Example NGINX L7 Load Balancer
http {
  upstream backend {
    server app1.example.com;
    server app2.example.com;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Distribute web traffic
- Scale horizontal server fleets
- Ensure HA across zones or regions

---

## üîÑ Reverse Proxy

### üß† What It Does

A **Reverse Proxy** sits in front of one or more servers and **forwards client requests** to them. It **hides backend implementation details**, can cache responses, and terminate SSL.

```
// Example: NGINX reverse proxy
server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- SSL termination
- Load balancing
- Caching
- URL/path rewriting
- Security enforcement

> üîé NGINX and HAProxy are often used as **both** reverse proxies and load balancers.

---

## üö™ API Gateway

### üß† What It Does

An **API Gateway** is a specialized reverse proxy that **manages and routes API traffic**. It often includes features like **authentication**, **rate limiting**, **logging**, and **API versioning**.

```
// Example: API Gateway routes
/api/v1/users ‚Üí users-service
/api/v1/orders ‚Üí orders-service
```

### ‚ú® Features

- Request/response transformation
- API key and token validation (OAuth2, JWT)
- Quotas and throttling
- Monitoring and analytics
- CORS handling
- Header injection

### üß∞ Examples

- **Kong**, **AWS API Gateway**, **Apigee**, **Traefik**, **Istio**, **Zuul**

---

## üïµÔ∏è Forward Proxy (Bonus)

### üß† What It Does

Unlike a reverse proxy, a **Forward Proxy** is used **by clients** to access external resources. It acts on behalf of the client.

```
Client ‚Üí Forward Proxy ‚Üí Internet
```

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Content filtering (corporate firewalls)
- Access control
- Anonymity (Tor, VPNs)

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Ingress Controller (Kubernetes-Specific)

### üß† What It Does

A **Kubernetes Ingress Controller** is a reverse proxy that handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic and routes it to services in the cluster.

```
// Example ingress route
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
