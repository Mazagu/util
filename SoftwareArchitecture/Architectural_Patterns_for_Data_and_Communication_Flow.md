# 🔄 Architectural Patterns for Data and Communication Flow

This guide covers **common architectural patterns** used to structure how data and communication flow within distributed systems. These patterns solve integration, scalability, and maintainability challenges across services and components.

---

## 🔁 Communication Patterns

These patterns define **how components interact** in a system.

---

### 🔹 1. Request-Response

The client sends a request and waits for the server to respond. This is the most traditional and synchronous pattern.

- **Use Cases**: REST APIs, RPC calls, internal service communication
- **Pros**: Simple, intuitive
- **Cons**: Tightly coupled, blocking latency

```
// Example HTTP call
GET /user/123 → 200 OK
```

---

### 🔹 2. Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe)

Publishers emit messages to a broker, and subscribers receive relevant messages asynchronously.

- **Use Cases**: Event-driven microservices, notifications, log pipelines
- **Pros**: Decoupled, scalable
- **Cons**: Delivery guarantees vary, difficult to trace

```
// Publisher sends event to "user.signup"
publish("user.signup", { id: 123 })

// Subscribers listen to the topic
on("user.signup", handleWelcomeEmail)
```

---

### 🔹 3. API Gateway

A single entry point to route, authenticate, and shape traffic to internal services.

- **Use Cases**: Microservice-based architectures, external APIs
- **Pros**: Centralized management, security, analytics
- **Cons**: Single point of failure if not designed properly

---

### 🔹 4. Peer-to-Peer

Components communicate directly with each other without intermediaries.

- **Use Cases**: File sharing (BitTorrent), mesh networks
- **Pros**: Decentralized, resilient
- **Cons**: Harder to coordinate and secure

---

### 🔹 5. Orchestration

A central orchestrator controls the sequence and interaction between services.

- **Use Cases**: Workflow engines, CI/CD pipelines, data pipelines
- **Pros**: Visibility, control, step-by-step logic
- **Cons**: Tight coupling to orchestrator logic

---

## 🧠 State & Data Flow Patterns

These patterns focus on how data flows and is stored or transformed across the system.

---

### 🔹 6. Event Sourcing

Store all state changes as a sequence of events, rather than current state.

- **Use Cases**: Audit trails, undo/redo functionality, temporal data
- **Pros**: Replayable, auditable
- **Cons**: Rebuilding state can be expensive, event versioning needed

```
// Events stored: UserCreated, EmailUpdated
replay(events) → state
```

---

### 🔹 7. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Extract data from sources, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse.

- **Use Cases**: Data warehousing, reporting, BI tools
- **Pros**: Clean, structured data for analysis
- **Cons**: Not real-time, batch-oriented

```
// Pseudo-ETL
data = extract(csv)
clean = transform(data)
load(clean, warehouse)
```

---

### 🔹 8. Streaming Processing

Process and analyze data in real-time as it's produced.

- **Use Cases**: Fraud detection, real-time metrics, IoT
- **Pros**: Low latency insights
- **Cons**: More complex infrastructure

```
// Kafka consumer
consume("sensor.data") → process(stream)
```

---

### 🔹 9. Batching

Accumulate data until a size or time threshold is reached, then process it in bulk.

- **Use Cases**: Email sending, scheduled imports, billing
- **Pros**: Resource efficient, reduces overhead
- **Cons**: Latency between events and processing
