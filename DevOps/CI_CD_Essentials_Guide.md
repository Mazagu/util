# ⚙️ CI/CD Essentials Guide

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automates the process of building, testing, and releasing software. It increases development speed, quality, and reliability by reducing manual errors and enabling frequent, incremental changes.

## 🔁 What is CI/CD?

| Term  | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **CI (Continuous Integration)** | Automating code integration into a shared repo with frequent builds and tests. |
| **CD (Continuous Delivery)** | Automatically prepares builds for release to production. Requires a manual approval step. |
| **CD (Continuous Deployment)** | Automatically releases every passing change to production without manual approval. |

## 🧱 Key CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Stage**
   - Triggered on code push, PR, or schedule
   - Source: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

2. **Build Stage**
   - Compile code, resolve dependencies, generate artifacts
   - Tools: Maven, Gradle, Webpack, Docker

3. **Test Stage**
   - Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
   - Frameworks: JUnit, Mocha, Cypress, PyTest

4. **Artifact Stage**
   - Package and store built artifacts
   - Tools: JFrog Artifactory, Nexus, GitHub Packages

5. **Deploy Stage**
   - Deploy to staging, QA, or production
   - Tools: ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible

6. **Post-deployment**
   - Smoke tests, rollback triggers, observability

## 🛠️ Common CI/CD Tools

| Function         | Tools |
|------------------|-------|
| Version Control  | Git, GitHub, GitLab |
| CI Runners       | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins |
| Artifact Repos   | Nexus, JFrog Artifactory |
| Container Build  | Docker, BuildKit, Kaniko |
| Deploy Automation| ArgoCD, Flux, Helm, Terraform |
| Monitoring       | Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic |

## 🔐 Security in CI/CD

- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (`Snyk`, `Trivy`)
- Use **secrets management** (e.g. HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Secrets)
- Validate infrastructure code (Terraform, Kube configs)
- Enforce **code reviews** and signed commits
- Use isolated runners and limit permission scopes

---

## 🚨 CI/CD Best Practices

✅ Keep pipelines fast (< 10 minutes)  
✅ Run tests early and in parallel  
✅ Automate rollback and recovery  
✅ Promote from staging → prod  
✅ Use immutable artifacts  
✅ Enforce linting and style checks  
✅ Version your CI/CD config (YAML)  
✅ Don't hardcode secrets or credentials

## 🔄 Deployment Strategies

| Strategy         | Description                          | Use Case                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Rolling Update   | Gradually replace old with new pods  | Most common with K8s            |
| Blue-Green       | Deploy to idle environment, switch   | Low-risk, easy rollback         |
| Canary           | Deploy to small % of users, then all | Feature testing, risk mitigation|
| GitOps           | Use Git as source of truth           | Declarative infra & apps        |

## 🧪 Testing in CI/CD

| Test Type         | What it Checks                         | Stage       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Unit Test         | Individual function logic              | Early (CI)  |
| Integration Test  | Module interaction                     | Mid (CI)    |
| End-to-End (E2E)  | App behavior as user                   | Late (CD)   |
| Smoke Test        | Basic sanity checks post-deploy        | Deploy/CD   |
| Load/Perf Test    | Scale, latency, throughput             | CD or Prod  |

## 🌐 Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

Automate your infrastructure deployments using:

- **Terraform**, **Pulumi** – For provisioning
- **Helm**, **Kustomize** – For Kubernetes manifests
- **Dockerfiles** – For container builds
- **Ansible**, **Chef** – For configuration management

---

## 🔍 Observability & Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- 📈 Metrics (CPU, latency, error rate)
- 📋 Logs (stdout, error logs, app logs)
- 🔔 Alerts (PagerDuty, Slack, Opsgenie)
- 🎯 Tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)
