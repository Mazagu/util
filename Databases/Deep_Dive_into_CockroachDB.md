# 🪳 Deep Dive into CockroachDB

**CockroachDB** is a distributed SQL database designed to be **highly available**, **scalable**, and **resilient** to failures — much like the insect it's named after. It’s **PostgreSQL-compatible** and aims to offer the scalability of NoSQL with the consistency and familiarity of SQL.

---

## 🚀 What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a **cloud-native, distributed relational database** designed to:
- **Survive failures automatically**
- **Scale horizontally without manual sharding**
- **Maintain SQL semantics and ACID guarantees**

---

## 🧬 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🛡️ Strong Consistency | Uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency across replicas |
| 🧠 PostgreSQL Compatibility | Supports most of the PostgreSQL dialect (DDL, DML, drivers, tooling) |
| 🌐 Multi-Region Aware | Data can be located near users or comply with data residency laws |
| 🔁 Automatic Replication | Automatically replicates data across nodes |
| 📦 Distributed SQL Execution | Queries are planned and executed across the cluster |
| 💥 Fault Tolerance | Can survive machine, disk, or even entire region failures |
| 📈 Horizontal Scalability | Add nodes to scale out without downtime or sharding logic |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

CockroachDB is a **shared-nothing distributed system** composed of identical nodes. Each node:

- Stores part of the data in **key-value ranges**
- Participates in **Raft consensus groups** for replication
- Is capable of serving reads and writes (depending on lease ownership)

### 📦 Key Concepts

- **Ranges**: Units of data (64 MiB by default), replicated using Raft
- **Leases**: Determines which replica can serve consistent reads
- **Zone Configs**: Rules to control data placement, retention, and replication

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. 🚦 SQL API

CockroachDB speaks PostgreSQL wire protocol — you can connect using `psql`, JDBC, pgAdmin, etc.

### 2. ⚙️ Query Planning & Execution

- A SQL query is parsed and optimized
- Execution is distributed to relevant nodes (depending on data locality)

### 3. 🔁 Replication & Raft

- Every range is replicated (default 3 times)
- Raft ensures consensus on changes (2 out of 3 votes for writes)

### 4. 🌍 Multi-Region Distribution

You can place data closer to users via **partitioning**, **regional tables**, or **global tables**:

| Type            | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|
| **Regional Tables** | Reads/writes optimized for one region |
| **Global Tables**   | Read-mostly data available everywhere |
| **Partitioned Tables** | Explicit control over data location |

---

## 🧪 ACID Transactions

CockroachDB supports **fully serializable transactions** with:

- **Optimistic concurrency control**
- **Distributed two-phase commits (2PC)**
- **Clock-based timestamps (hybrid logical clocks)**

```
// Transaction example
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

## 📦 Use Cases

✅ Globally distributed applications  
✅ SaaS applications with multi-tenant isolation  
✅ Mission-critical workloads needing high availability  
✅ PostgreSQL-compatible apps needing scale

---

## 💻 Getting Started (Local)

```
// Start single-node CockroachDB cluster
cockroach start-single-node --insecure --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --http-addr=localhost:8080 --store=local-data

// Open SQL shell
cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost:26257
```

---

## 🔐 Security

- Supports TLS for node and client communication
- RBAC-style SQL user and role permissions
- Audit logging and password policies

---

## 🧑‍💼 Admin Tasks

| Task             | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| Create User      | `CREATE USER alice;` |
| Create Database  | `CREATE DATABASE appdb;` |
| Backup           | `BACKUP TO 's3://bucket/backup';` |
| Restore          | `RESTORE FROM 's3://bucket/backup';` |
| Node Status      | `cockroach node status --insecure` |

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- Web UI at `http://localhost:8080`
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Structured logs and debug zip bundles

---

## ☁️ Deployment Options

| Option        | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Self-Hosted** | Install manually on VMs or Kubernetes |
| **CockroachCloud** | Fully-managed offering (AWS/GCP) |
| **Kubernetes Operator** | Automate deployment with Helm or Operator SDK |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use **multi-region partitioning** for geo-distributed apps
- Leverage **global tables** for read-heavy reference data
- Monitor **Raft leadership balance** for performance
- Design with **hotspot avoidance** in mind (e.g. avoid sequential IDs)
