# 🟣 Deep Dive into Apache Cassandra

**Apache Cassandra** is a **highly scalable**, **distributed NoSQL database** designed to handle large volumes of structured data across many commodity servers. It provides **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **eventual consistency** with no single point of failure.

---

## 📌 Overview

- ✅ **NoSQL**: Schema-optional, wide-column store
- 🌍 **Distributed**: Peer-to-peer architecture, no master-slave
- ⚡ **Highly Available**: Designed for zero downtime
- 🌱 **Scalable**: Horizontally scales linearly with minimal effort

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Node**             | Basic storage unit in the cluster |
| **Cluster**          | Collection of nodes |
| **Data Center**      | Logical grouping of nodes (can represent physical DCs) |
| **Keyspace**         | Top-level namespace (like database) |
| **Table**            | Stores data in rows with flexible columns |
| **Partition Key**    | Determines data distribution across nodes |
| **Replication Factor** | Number of copies of data stored across nodes |

---

## ⚙️ Architecture

### 🔁 Peer-to-Peer Model

- All nodes are equal; no single point of failure
- Nodes gossip to discover and communicate with each other

### 🔄 Consistent Hashing & Token Ring

- Each node owns a **range of tokens**
- Data is distributed based on **hash of the partition key**
- Easy to scale: just add nodes, and token ranges are redistributed

### 🧱 Storage Engine

- Write path uses **commit log + memtable**
- Periodically flushed to **SSTables**
- Uses **LSM Tree** (Log-Structured Merge Tree) to optimize writes

---

## 🧮 Data Model

Cassandra uses a **wide-column model** (similar to Bigtable).

```sql
CREATE TABLE users_by_country (
  country text,
  user_id uuid,
  name text,
  email text,
  PRIMARY KEY (country, user_id)
);
```

- `country` is the **partition key**
- `user_id` is the **clustering column**

```
// Insert data
INSERT INTO users_by_country (country, user_id, name, email)
VALUES ('US', uuid(), 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');

// Query by partition
SELECT * FROM users_by_country WHERE country = 'US';
```

## 🔐 Consistency & Availability

Cassandra offers **tunable consistency**:

| Level        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| ONE          | A single node responds |
| QUORUM       | Majority of replicas respond |
| ALL          | All replicas respond |

You choose **consistency level** per read/write depending on needs.

> Rule of thumb: **R + W > RF** ensures strong consistency.

## ⚙️ Write Path

1. Client writes to **commit log** (durable)
2. Data written to **memtable**
3. Memtable is flushed to disk as **SSTable**
4. Background **compaction** merges SSTables

---

## 📖 Read Path

1. Check **Bloom filters** to avoid unnecessary reads
2. Look into **memtable**, then **row cache**, then **SSTables**
3. Merge results and return to client

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

✅ Time-series data  
✅ Real-time analytics  
✅ IoT backends  
✅ Recommendation engines  
✅ User activity/event tracking

---

## 📈 Performance and Scaling

- **Scale reads and writes by adding nodes**
- No need to shard data manually
- **Local quorum reads** improve performance in multi-DC setups
- Writes are **fast**, but reads can be **slower** compared to in-memory databases

---

## 🛠️ Operations and Tools

| Task            | Tool / Command |
|------------------|----------------|
| Monitoring       | `nodetool`, Prometheus + Grafana |
| Backup           | `nodetool snapshot` |
| Repairs          | `nodetool repair` |
| Adding Nodes     | Automatic data rebalance |
| Compaction       | Periodic SSTable merge |
| Cassandra Shell  | `cqlsh` (Cassandra Query Language shell) |

---

## 🌐 Multi-Region & High Availability

- Supports **multiple data centers**
- Can use **local quorum** for latency-sensitive operations
- **NetworkTopologyStrategy** allows specifying replication per DC

---

## 🔐 Security

- Authentication and authorization (RBAC)
- SSL/TLS encryption for node-to-node and client-to-node
- Audit logging and role-based access

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

✅ Choose good partition keys to avoid hot spots  
✅ Use `QUORUM` for strong consistency  
✅ Regularly repair data (anti-entropy repair)  
✅ Avoid large partitions (> 100k rows)  
✅ Don’t use Cassandra like a relational DB — no joins!
