# üåê Deep Dive into NGINX

NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. Originally designed to solve the **C10k problem** (handling 10,000+ concurrent connections), it has evolved into a **powerful all-in-one solution** for web serving, load balancing, reverse proxying, content caching, and more.

## üîß Architecture Overview

At its core, NGINX uses an **event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking architecture**, which allows it to scale extremely well under heavy loads.

### Key Components:
- **Master Process**: Manages worker processes and reads configuration.
- **Worker Processes**: Handle requests using non-blocking I/O and event loops.
- **Event Loop**: Processes connections asynchronously, enabling high concurrency with low memory usage.
- **Modules**: NGINX is modular ‚Äî you can enable/disable features such as SSL, caching, and compression.

This architecture allows NGINX to handle **thousands of concurrent connections** with a small memory footprint.

## üöÄ High-Performance Web Server

NGINX can serve static content (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) **blazingly fast**.

### Why it's fast:
- Event-driven design (vs. Apache's thread-based model)
- Efficient resource usage
- Content is read asynchronously from disk

### Example:
```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
  root /var/www/html;
  index index.html;
}
```

## üîÅ Reverse Proxy and Load Balancing

NGINX shines as a **reverse proxy**, acting as an intermediary between clients and backend servers (e.g., application servers like Node.js, Python, etc.).

### Use Cases:
- Hide backend architecture
- Load balance traffic across multiple servers
- Centralize SSL termination and caching

### Load Balancing Strategies:
- **Round Robin** (default)
- **Least Connections**
- **IP Hash** (sticky sessions)

### Example:
```
http {
  upstream backend {
    server app1.example.com;
    server app2.example.com;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ö° Content Caching

NGINX can act as a **caching layer**, storing static or dynamic responses to reduce load on origin servers.

### Benefits:
- Reduces latency
- Improves throughput
- Lowers backend load

### Example:
```
location / {
  proxy_pass http://backend;
  proxy_cache my_cache;
  proxy_cache_valid 200 302 10m;
  proxy_cache_valid 404 1m;
}
```

To enable caching:
```
proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m max_size=1g inactive=60m use_temp_path=off;
```

## üîê SSL Termination

NGINX is often used to **terminate SSL/TLS connections**, offloading the encryption work from backend servers.

### Benefits:
- Centralized certificate management
- Reduce load on application servers
- Support modern SSL configurations (OCSP Stapling, HTTP/2, etc.)

### Example:
```
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name example.com;

  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
  }
}
```
